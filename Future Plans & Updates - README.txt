If you're interested in helping out in this project, let me know! Best place to reach me is messaging me on the Nexus Forums so I can keep it organized.

I'm currently looking for someone with C# coding abilities for creating and compiling complex dlls as I'm absolutely terrible at it (slowly learning). A few people might be better if we're taking on a big project like this.

People who are comfortable with editing XMLs are also welcome!

3D Artists, or modelers will also be sought after once we have the ability to edit meshes.

People comfortable with editing GUI to give the UI a more fantasy theme would also be nice.

Voice Actors are going to be great once we get some of the quests written out.

There will probably be more things we'll need. But this is a good list at the moment. :)
